    h2 Here are some other things I am in to 
    p I own a coffee shop called, #[a.about-list(href='https://kingdom-coffee.com') Kingdom Coffee] with some friends and love doing dev work there. I did not build our website, but I will be rebuilding it very soon.
    p I own a studio and play in a music collective called, #[a.about-list(href='https://kingdomchoirs.com') Kingdom Choirs]. I did quickly build this site on a nice looking WP theme called Uncode. You may notice the Kingdom Choirs site uses the same fonts as this site. I love these nerdy fonts.
